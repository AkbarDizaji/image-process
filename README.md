## About this project

This repository is merely at the level of a Proof of Concept (POC), and naturally, the project has the potential for a great deal of detail that certainly cannot be achieved within a half-day effort. This project is merely focused on adding and displaying images.

Some of the things I would have liked to spend more time on, if available, include:
- Adding other functionalities such as image deletion, editing, resizing, and more.-
- Creating a visually more appealing interface using different components.
- Writing more comprehensive tests for boundary cases and also tests in Vue application.
- Follow CQRS for seperate write and read path.
- And other aspects that I may not have initially realized during my initial understanding of the task.
